      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>This Refund & Cancellation Policy (“Policy”) governs all purchases, subscriptions, and payments made by users of Krutsha (“we,” “our,” “us”). By making a purchase, you (“user,” “you”) agree to the terms below.</p>

      <h3>2. Nature of Service</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Krutsha provides AI-generated responses and related services, which are <strong>intangible, digital products</strong>.</li>
        <li>Since results are automatically generated and may vary in accuracy or relevance, all purchases are considered delivered once access is granted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. General Refund Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All sales are final.</strong> Refunds will not be issued once a product, subscription, or service has been purchased or activated.</li>
        <li>Users acknowledge that variations in accuracy, usefulness, or satisfaction with AI responses do not qualify as grounds for a refund.</li>
        <li>Refunds are not provided for partial usage of a subscription.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Eligibility for Refunds (Exceptional Cases)</h3>
      <p>Refunds may only be considered in the following exceptional situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Duplicate Billing/Charges:</strong> If a user has been charged multiple times in error for the same service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any refund, if approved, will be processed at Krutsha’s sole discretion.</p>

        <li>User errors, such as input mistakes, forgotten credentials, or non-compliance with usage guidelines.</li>
        <li>Service outages caused by internet issues, third-party downtime, or factors outside Krutsha's reasonable control.</li>
        <li>Misuse, abuse, or violation of Terms & Conditions.</li>
        <li>Subscription cancellations made mid-term (users may continue to access until the billing cycle ends, but no prorated refund is given).</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h3>9. Modifications to Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Krutsha reserves the right to amend or update this Refund Policy at any time.</li>
